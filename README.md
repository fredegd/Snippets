This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## >Snippets_
is a continuous, self-initiated project that is currently in its Beta version stage, undergoing ongoing improvements and enhancements.

The website serves as a repository for personally curated code snippet blocks, crafted for easy recall and reuse. Within this collection, you'll find a diverse rangeâ€”some snippets are raw, straightforward, and to the point, while others are intricately detailed, providing comprehensive insights.

The vision for this project extends beyond an individual catalog. I am planning to let evolve this platform into a community-driven space, inviting users to share their own favorite collections. Through this collaborative effort, it aims to collect a vibrant exchange of coding knowledge and techniques.

As it continues to develop, Snippets aims to become a go-to destination for developers seeking both quick references and in-depth coding solutions, fostering a collaborative environment where coding enthusiasts can learn, contribute, and grow together.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
